            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Responsive Design in terms of web technology is a design theorem meant to emphasize a </p>
            <p>web page's ability to be compatible on different platforms. This means that the web page</p>
            <p>would render effectively on various devices with different size screens. To achieve</p>
            <p>responsive design using scalable units such as percent and EM’s over fixed units such as </p>
            <p>points or pixels is crutial. During my research I read about how to use the scalable</p>
            <p>units correctly as i've never had any experience using this kind of design</p>
            <p>scheme before. With a growing user base using exclusively mobile devices it is important </p>
            <p>that these users have access to websites that are compatible.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I used the one column design for my webpage because it made the most sense for</p>
            <p>what I envisioned for my online store. I used percentage scale for the images displayed on</p>
            <p>my store front page replacing the pixel units I used previously. I did this by trial and error to </p>
            <p>find the correct image dimensions using percent and then with some simple math calculated that</p>
            <p>1% = 13.513 px. For the display of my webpage I put the entire thing into </p>
            <p>a Div and set it to display at 90% in the css file. To ensure the main content does not</p>
            <p>render incorrectly I added another tag "Section" called main that covers the body of the html to display</p>
            <p>at 100%. I also did all the css measurements using EM’s instead of pixels to make all the</p>
            <p>formatting compatible with any sized display screen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During this assignment I learned how to incorporate scalable units into the design of my</p>
            <p>website and how to follow different design patterns such as the single column design I used</p>
            <p>among others.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thank you for the course sir.</p>
